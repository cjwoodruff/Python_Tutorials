# Set up the initial variables for comparison
x = 5 
y = 6

# Initial boolean comparisons
print(y > x) # Output: True
print(y < x) # Output: False

    print(True)
else:
    print(False)
    
# THe following code is modified to be placed into an IDE and not the console
# by using the print() method.
print(True + True) # Output: 2
print(True * True) # Output: 1
print(True - False) # Output: 1
pritn(False/True) # Output: 0
