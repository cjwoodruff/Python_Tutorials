Source Code from the lessons

This code is free to use. It was made up as I went. So, feel free to tear it apart and criticize it as you see fit.
If you have any comments or can't get it to work, feel free to contact me through my site as cjwoody.com. These were retyped
from memory and could have some key typos in them.

Thank you for your input.
